        <h1>Death to Life: My Early Beginnings</h1>
        <small>James Geiger</small>
        <p>
          I was born prematurely, 9 weeks early. I weighed just 1 pound 2 ounces
          and it seemed like my life was already over. But here I am today!
          Disability has never stopped me from living the life that I wanted to
          live — even if sometimes it’s hard. Disability has given me the
          opportunity to see life from a different perspective — one where there
          are few limits placed on what can be achieved or attempted in order to
          live a meaningful life. This blog post is about my early beginnings in
          this world; how life started for a child who was originally born dead.
          <br />
          <br />
          It all began in Tacoma, Washington, in 1984, when my biological mother
          was using drugs and alcohol. My mother had health issues that
          necessitated my birth nine weeks early. I would be devoid of life when
          I emerged from her womb. The physicians were able to resuscitate me,
          thankfully.
          <br />
          <br />
          They were aware that I had brain damage, but not exactly how severe it
          would be.
          <br />
          <br />
          My mother knew she wouldn’t be able to care for me, so she put me up
          for adoption.
          <br />
          <br />
          Meanwhile, in Maine, there was this married couple working with an
          adoption agency. The agency learned of me. The couple was informed of
          my birth difficulties by the agency, but because the wife was a nurse
          in the Army, they were not deterred. They flew to Washington right
          away to meet me. It turned out to be love at first sight. The father
          immediately remarked, “That’s my kid!” Then, after a while, they
          officially adopted me!
